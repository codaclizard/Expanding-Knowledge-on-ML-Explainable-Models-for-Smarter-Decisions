Introduction - This paper talks about, Explainable Machine Learning, which is an essential field in AI that focuses on deciphering complex machine learning models that aids in various driving the conclusion-making methods. Its objective is to provide understandable insights into how these models arrive at predictions or decisions, crucial for trust and accountability. XAI employs various techniques like feature importance analysis, Evaluating the impact of  input characteristics on predictions is crucial in building robust, interpretable, and efficient machine learning models. Approaches like permutation advantages, SHAP or LIME help identify influential features, enhancing comprehension of model behaviour. Moreover, it promotes transparent model types (e.g., decision trees) whose structure is more interpretable than complex models like neural networks. The importance of XAI lies in fostering trust, ensuring regulatory compliance, identifying biases, and enabling experts to verify and enhance  model performance. Its role is pivotal across sectors like healthcare, finance, and justice, ensuring responsible and ethical AI deployment in diverse applications.
